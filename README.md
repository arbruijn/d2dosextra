## Changes

v1.21 - Increase number of possible level songs from 24 to 58

## Build

You'll need Watcom 9.5b, MASM 6.11, the Descent 2 1.2 Vertigo exe and a DOS environment, for example DOSBox.

The Descent 2 exe must be copied to the `original` directory.

Start compilation with `wmake` in the top directory.
